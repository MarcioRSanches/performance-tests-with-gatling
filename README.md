# Gatling Tests (WIP)

It is a simple project to start performance tests using Gatling with Maven. 

If you want to run this on your machine, you'll need:
 
* Java 8
* Maven 3.6
* Scala Plugin Installed (if you use IntelliJ or Eclipse)
 
After that, clone this repository and run the following command:

```
mvn clean gatling:test
```

You can use this as a base to start your own performance test project.
